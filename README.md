# Learn to Code with Basketball 
This learning is based on the Book **Learn to Code with Basektball** by Nathan Braun and few courses from Maven Analytics.
I highly recommend the course to anyone interested learning about data science in combination with basketball. 

## What is Business Intelligence?
- Typically focused on **descriptive analytics**: *What happened, why did it happen, how can we learn from it?*
- Often deals with **specific, known questions**: *Why are our sales declining?* *Which products drive the highest ROI?*
- Designed to deal with **static, structured** data sources (*tabular datasets*)
- GOAL: **identify patterns & trends** to turn data into insights. 

## What is Data? 
At a high level, data is *collection of structured information* (CIS). 

For a basketball game, a collection of structured information looks as follows: 
- What is a basketball game a **collection** of?
  - A collection of players, teams, possessions, quarters, shots
- What **information** might we have about each shot in this collection?
  - The player shooting, where it is on the court, how much time is left, what the score was, etc.
- Finally, it's **structured** as a big rectangle with columns and rows.
  - A *row* is a single item in our collection (a shot here). It's common to refer rows as **observations**. 
  - A *column* is one piece of information (shooter, distance, etc.). We refer columns as **variables**
 
The **granularity** of dataset is another word for the level the collection is at. 

## What is Analysis? 
Types of Data Analysis 
Broadly, it is useful to think of two types of analysis, both of which involve reducing a pile of data into a few, more manageable number of insights. 
1. Single number type summary statistics.
2. Models that help us understand relationships between data.

A key skill in data analaysis is knowing how to look at data multiple ways via different summary statistics, keeping in mind their strenghts and weaknesses. 

### Modeling
A model describes a mathematical *relationship* between variables in your data, specifically the relationship between one or more *input variables* and one *outuput variable*. 

*output variable* = model(*input variables*)
